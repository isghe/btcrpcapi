estimatefee nblocks<br/><br/>DEPRECATED. Please use estimatesmartfee for more intelligent estimates.<br/>Estimates the approximate fee per kilobyte needed for a transaction to begin<br/>confirmation within nblocks blocks. Uses virtual transaction size of transaction<br/>as defined in BIP 141 (witness data is discounted).<br/><br/>Arguments:<br/>1. nblocks     (numeric, required)<br/><br/>Result:<br/>n              (numeric) estimated fee-per-kilobyte<br/><br/>A negative value is returned if not enough transactions and blocks<br/>have been observed to make an estimate.<br/>-1 is always returned for nblocks == 1 as it is impossible to calculate<br/>a fee that is high enough to get reliably included in the next block.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>> bitcoin-cli estimatefee 6<br/>
